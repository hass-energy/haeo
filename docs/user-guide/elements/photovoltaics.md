# Photovoltaics

Solar panels that generate electricity.
HAEO optimizes how generated power flows through your energy network.

## Configuration

| Field                                     | Type                                     | Required | Default | Description                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[Name](#name)**                         | String                                   | Yes      | -       | Unique identifier for this photovoltaic system                  |
| **[Forecast](#forecast)**                 | [sensor(s)](../forecasts-and-sensors.md) | Yes      | -       | Solar generation forecast sensor(s) providing power output (kW) |
| **[Production Price](#production-price)** | Number (\$/kWh)                          | No       | 0       | Cost or value per kWh of electricity generated                  |
| **[Curtailment](#curtailment)**           | Boolean                                  | No       | false   | Allow optimizer to reduce generation below forecast             |

## Name

Unique identifier for this photovoltaic system within your HAEO configuration.
Used to create sensor entity IDs and identify the solar array in connections.

**Examples**: "Rooftop Solar", "East Array", "West Array", "Combined Solar"

## Forecast

Specify one or more Home Assistant sensors providing solar generation data.

**Single array example**:

| Field        | Value                      |
| ------------ | -------------------------- |
| **Forecast** | sensor.solcast_pv_forecast |

**Multiple arrays example** (e.g., different orientations):

| Field        | Value                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Forecast** | sensor.solar_east_forecast, sensor.solar_west_forecast |

Provide all solar array forecasts to get accurate total generation predictions.
See the [Forecasts and Sensors guide](../forecasts-and-sensors.md) for details on how HAEO processes sensor data.

## Production Price

Cost or value per kWh of electricity generated.

**Default**: Leave empty for zero cost (most common case)

**When to use non-zero values**:

- Modeling opportunity cost of generation
- Accounting for maintenance costs per kWh
- Rare specialized scenarios

!!! note

    Production price is NOT the same as export price.
    Export revenue is configured on the Grid element.

## Curtailment

Allow HAEO to reduce generation below the forecast level.

**Default**: Disabled (generation follows forecast exactly)

**When enabled**: HAEO can curtail generation if:

- Export prices are negative (paying to export)
- Export limit is reached
- Battery is full and loads are satisfied

**Requirements**:

- Inverter must support active power limiting
- Control mechanism must be implemented separately (HAEO only optimizes)

## Configuration Examples

### Basic Configuration

Single solar array with forecast:

| Field                | Value                      |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Name**             | Rooftop Solar              |
| **Forecast**         | sensor.solcast_pv_forecast |
| **Production Price** | 0                          |
| **Curtailment**      | false                      |

### Multiple Arrays

Combine multiple solar arrays or forecast sources:

| Field                | Value                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Name**             | Combined Solar                                         |
| **Forecast**         | sensor.east_array_forecast, sensor.west_array_forecast |
| **Production Price** | 0                                                      |
| **Curtailment**      | false                                                  |

## Sensors Created

These sensors provide real-time visibility into solar generation and curtailment decisions.

| Sensor                                                 | Unit   | Description                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| [`sensor.{name}_power_produced`](#power-produced)      | kW     | Actual power generated                  |
| [`sensor.{name}_power_available`](#power-available)    | kW     | Maximum available solar power           |
| [`sensor.{name}_price_production`](#price-production)  | \$/kWh | Current production price                |
| [`sensor.{name}_power_balance`](#power-balance)        | \$/kW  | Marginal value of solar power           |
| [`sensor.{name}_forecast_limit`](#forecast-limit) (\*) | \$/kW  | Value of additional generation capacity |

(\*) Only created when curtailment is enabled

### Power Produced

The optimal power generated by the solar array at each time period after any curtailment decisions.

This represents the actual power output from the photovoltaic system.
When curtailment is disabled, this equals the available power from the forecast.
When curtailment is enabled, this may be less than available power if the optimizer determines curtailing generation reduces total system cost.

**Example**: A value of 4.2 kW means the solar array is producing 4.2 kW at this time period.

### Power Available

The maximum solar power available from the forecast before any curtailment.

This represents what the solar array could produce based on weather forecasts and system capacity.
It serves as the upper limit for actual generation.
The difference between `power_available` and `power_produced` shows how much generation is being curtailed.

**Example**: A value of 5.0 kW when `power_produced` is 4.2 kW means 0.8 kW of solar generation is being curtailed at this time.

### Price Production

The current production price for solar generation from the configured production price sensor(s).

This is the value or cost associated with producing electricity from solar.
Typically zero (solar is free), but can be configured to reflect system degradation, maintenance costs, or other factors.
When positive, it acts as a cost of generation.
When negative, it acts as a benefit of generation (uncommon).

**Example**: A value of 0 means there is no explicit cost or value assigned to solar generation itself (most common configuration).

### Power Balance

The marginal value of solar power at the array terminals.
See the [Shadow Prices modeling guide](../../modeling/shadow-prices.md) for general shadow price concepts.

This shadow price represents what you save or earn per kW of solar generation at this time period.
It reflects the value of solar power in the context of your entire energy system (grid prices, battery state, loads, etc.).

**Interpretation**:

- **Positive value**: Solar generation is valuable (offsetting expensive grid imports or enabling valuable exports)
- **Zero value**: Solar generation has no marginal value (unusual, may indicate system is unconstrained)
- **Negative value**: Solar generation has negative value (typically when grid export prices are negative and battery is full)
- **Magnitude**: Higher values indicate solar generation is more valuable at this time

**Example**: A value of 0.25 means that each kW of solar generation is worth \$0.25 at this time period, either by offsetting grid imports or enabling exports.

### Forecast Limit

The marginal value of additional generation capacity.
See the [Shadow Prices modeling guide](../../modeling/shadow-prices.md) for general shadow price concepts.

**Availability**: Only created when curtailment is enabled in the configuration.

This shadow price shows how much the total system cost would change if the solar forecast were increased by 1 kW at this time period.
It indicates whether more solar generation would be beneficial or detrimental.

**Interpretation**:

- **Zero value**: Not curtailing generation (using all available solar power)
- **Positive value**: System would benefit from more solar generation
    - More generation would reduce total system cost
    - If curtailing, suggests curtailment may be too aggressive
- **Negative value**: System is better off with less solar generation
    - Curtailing generation reduces total system cost
    - Typically occurs when export prices are negative or battery is full with nowhere for energy to go
    - More negative values indicate curtailing more aggressively would further reduce costs

**Example**: A value of -0.10 means that if the solar forecast were 1 kW higher, the total system cost would increase by \$0.10 at this time period, indicating that curtailing generation is economically beneficial.

All sensors include a `forecast` attribute containing future optimized values for upcoming periods.

## Troubleshooting

### Sensor Not Found

**Problem**: Error "Sensors not found or unavailable"

**Solutions**:

- Verify sensor entity ID exists in Home Assistant
- Check sensor is available (not "unavailable" or "unknown")
- Ensure solar forecast integration is configured correctly

### Incorrect Generation Values

**Problem**: Generation values don't match expectations

**Check**:

- Sensor units are kW (not W or kWh)
- Multiple sensors sum correctly (intended?)
- Forecast integration is providing realistic data
- System size configured correctly in forecast integration

### No Generation in Optimization

**Problem**: Optimization shows zero solar generation

**Possible causes**:

- Forecast covers wrong time period (nighttime only)
- Sensor values are zero due to weather
- Forecast data format not recognized

**Solutions**:

- Check sensor forecast attribute in Developer Tools → States
- Verify forecast covers daytime hours
- Review HAEO logs for format detection warnings
