# Linear Programming Overview

Introduction to linear programming and optimization concepts.
These are used by HAEO.

## What is Linear Programming?

Linear programming (LP) is a method to achieve the best outcome in a mathematical model.
Its requirements are represented by linear relationships.

## Key Components

- **Objective function**: What we want to minimize (cost)
- **Decision variables**: Power flows at each time step
- **Constraints**: Physical limits and requirements

## HAEO's Optimization Problem

HAEO solves:

$$
\text{minimize} \sum_{t} \text{Cost}(t)
$$

Subject to power balance, energy limits, and power limits.

See other modeling pages for detailed formulations.
